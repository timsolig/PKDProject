2h: Meeting with Tim and Viktor. Discussed different ideas for the project and worked through rules for our project in accordance with material provided on studium.

## 2021-02-16
0,5h: Meeting with TA and got our idea approved.
2h: Started to discuss how to organise the game. My task is to figure out how to move around. Made a superSimple MoveFunction and, concluded it was not applicable with gloss. Went back and studied the Gloss library again.

6h: Had an uphill battle with Gloss to make a dot move in a grid.

3h: Group session to merge git, we had not made logic changes to our branches so it took a very long time to manage and merge all work. Continued to discuss how to proceed with the project.
 
3h: Managed to make a "player" move in a maze without crossing walls. Challenge to link coordinates in maze picture with "maze"list, used tracing of players "maze" coordinates printed on the field so it was easier to compare positions.

3h: Group Session. Worked on removing buggs. Discussed that the way we have constructed the game is not really suitable.
 
## 2021-02-23
Group session. Spent 3 hours introducing data type "gameState" in the game. It was extensive work and very slow progress. 
 
## 2021-02-24
2h: Had a meeting with Viktor about his progress with gameState. Found his implementation of gameState to be better. Continued to work on his solution. 
 
## 2021-02-25
3h Group session. Continued work with new gameState. Fixed some bugs with player and goal, started to work on a game clock function.

## 2021-02-26
5h: Group session. Fine tuning of placement of text and visuals. Commenting functions and writing in the report. 


## 2021-02-27
0,5h read old reports provided on studium to get an understanding how the report should be written.
0,5h Drew goal and player picture in a simple paint editor
 
## 2021-03-01
1h rescaled goal and player picture so they follow the resizing of the maze between levels.
7h Group session. Working on the report and diary. Made a flowchart for the game.
