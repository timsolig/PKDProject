Brainstorming ideas and setting up GitHub. Settled on some rules for the project.

Deciding to do a maze game.

## 16 feb 2021
First meeting with TA. He liked our idea. Started exploring the gloss graphical package and  graph algorithms.

## 17 feb 2021
Some progress with graph algorithms. Got some Gloss windows to work.

## 19 feb 2021
Major Git issues. Took a lot of time. Then breakthrough with generating the maze. Settled on making "thinner" walls rather than having whole cells being walls.

## 22 feb 2021
First version of the game is working. However we want to introduce a start and goal menu. And the statistics, time, steps, and levels are not working.

## 23 2021
Started writing on the report. 

## 26 feb 2021
Version two is complete and the game now has menus and statistics. Every function is now commented. The report got a lot of work done.

## 1 march
A few cosmetic changes to the game e.g the player icon. The report is mostly finished.
