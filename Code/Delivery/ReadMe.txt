We just wanted to comment on two things to prevent getting the wrong feedback. 

--Examples
Since the result of our program is a graphically rendered window did we not really have the possibility of writing examples of some funcions. We could not write "func arg1 arg2 == something graphical". Therefore, we excluded examples in the function descriptions for functions returing a type from the gloss library.

--Tests
Same argument as for the examples. It only made sense to write tests for those functions which returns some numeric value or a boolean.
